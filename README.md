Project Title: Evaluating the Impact of Extra Tuition on Student Performance in Government Schools

Project Goal: To provide evidence-based recommendations to the government regarding the effectiveness of extra tuition for improving student mathematics scores.

Project Steps:

Initial Assessment and Proposal:
In a hypothetical scenario where the government sought to improve student math scores through a policy of extra tuition. I proposed a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) as the most reliable method to evaluate this program. My reasoning was that an RCT would allow for a clear and unbiased assessment of the tuition's impact.

Addressing Concerns and Clarifying Methodology:
Concerns arose regarding the use of a control group. I explained that simply comparing students who received tuition to those who didn't, or comparing scores before and after, wouldn't provide accurate results. Other factors could influence the outcomes. An RCT, with its random assignment, would isolate the tuition's effect.

Verifying Randomization:
I received baseline student data and checked for pre-treatment balance in mathematics scores. This was crucial to ensure that the treatment and control groups were comparable before the tuition program began. If there were significant differences initially, it would compromise the study's validity.
Analyzing Program Impact:

I obtained post-treatment data and merged it with the baseline data. I then conducted an ANCOVA regression to determine the impact of the tuition, controlling for baseline scores and other relevant factors. This allowed me to isolate the effect of the treatment.

I also performed a Difference in Differences analysis. This analysis method allowed me to see the change in test scores of the treatment group, compared to the change in test scores of the control group. This is a very robust way of seeing the effect of the treatment.
Investigating Unexpected Findings:

I examined the results for any unexpected outcomes. If any arose, I considered factors such as implementation issues or external influences that could have affected the results. I also considered that the simple random sampling method may have created some bias.

Refining the Evaluation:
To improve the precision of the evaluation, I recommended stratifying the treatment assignment by class section within each school. This would ensure a more balanced distribution of students across the treatment and control groups.
I then reran the ANCOVA and DiD regressions using this new stratified data.
Comparing and Interpreting Results:
I compared the results from the stratified analysis with the original analysis. This allowed me to assess the impact of stratification on the precision of the treatment effect estimates. I paid close attention to how much the bias from the simple random sampling method was reduced.

Formulating Recommendations:
Based on the analysis, I prepared a comprehensive report with evidence-based recommendations for the government. This included insights into the effectiveness of the tuition program and suggestions for potential improvements or alternative interventions.
